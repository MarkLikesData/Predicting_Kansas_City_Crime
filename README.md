THE BLAZER BOYS FINAL (BUT NOT FINAL) COUNTDOWN

Things to consider this evening...

We need to decide on which data to use (Crime or Housing)?

Crime data:

Pros

    Local (More pertinent),
    Current,
    Almost cleaned and ready for training,
    # of features = 7,
    Current version constantly shared and available to all

Cons

    Unsure if classification or regression is a better fit,
    "Smaller" dataset -- around 30,000 rows,
    Difficulty with Date/Time formatting

Housing data:

Pros

    Robust dataset,
    Well suited for Machine Learning

Cons

    Not local (Less pertinent),
    Not shared
